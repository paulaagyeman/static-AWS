    <h1>Hello, I'm Paula Agyeman, a student at UNT!</h1>
    <p> As a first-generation Ghanaian-American, driven by a lifelong curiosity and a desire to be a problem solver, my interest in software development, machine learning and information technology is rooted in the transformative impact they have on people's lives. Inspired by those who work in these fields, I'm drawn to their analytical and problem-solving nature, contributing to groundbreaking technologies that shape our world. 
      Through projects, I am mastering C++ and delving into languages like HTML/CSS, Python, and SQL. My pursuit is fueled by a profound desire to leverage technology's transformative power and create resolutions. Fluent coding not only enables creative problem-solving but also positions me to contribute actively to innovation, serving the world in unpredictable ways. Mastery in computer science and artificial intelligence serves as a gateway to crafting elegant solutions, pushing technology's boundaries, creating a more accessible world for others, and playing a pivotal role in shaping our digital future. 

Through all this, all glory be to God, my source. I strive to honor Him with each & every opportunity I receive. 
"So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God" - 1 Corinthians 10:31 </p>
